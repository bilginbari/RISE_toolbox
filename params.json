For any issue, suggestion or bug\r\nreport, please send an email to [junior.maih AT gmail.com](junior.maih@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nRISE is an object-oriented Matlab toolbox for solving and estimating nonlinear\r\nRegime-Switching Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (RS-DSGE) models.\r\n\r\nA new paper describing the problem and the solution approach in RISE\r\ncan be found [here](http://www.norges-bank.no/en/Published/Papers/Working-Papers/2015/12015/).\r\nOther references in the field include various papers by Dan Waggoner and Tao Zha, which\r\ncan be found [here](http://www.tzha.net/articles).\r\n\r\nIn RISE, the switching process and can be endogenous. RISE uses perturbation to approximate the nonlinear Regime-Switching DSGE (RS-DSGE) model and solves it using efficient algorithms.\r\n\r\nConstant-parameter DSGE models are a special case. RISE also includes the solution\r\nand estimation of\r\n* [Loose commitment](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8686985) (or optimal policy) models\r\n* sticky information models (Deprecated)\r\n* hybrid expectations models (Deprecated)\r\n* [models in which agents have information about future events](http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/events/research/2010CenBankForecasting/Maih_paper.pdf)\r\n\r\nFeatures of the toolbox\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n`*` - Symbolic, automatic and numerical derivatives\r\n\r\n`*` - Time Series\r\n\r\n`*` - Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation\r\n\r\n`*` - Derivative-free optimization algorithms\r\n\r\n`*` - Forecasting and conditional forecasting\r\n\r\n`*` - DSGE-VAR modeling\r\n\r\n`*` - Integrated SVAR modeling with short, long and mixed restrictions\r\n\r\n`*` - High Dimensional Model Representation and Monte Carlo Filtering\r\n\r\n`*` - Reporting\tsystem\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. Download the toolbox either as zip file or through github (recommended)\r\n2. add the toolbox path to Matlab and run rise_startup();\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n---------------------\r\n* This publicly available version of RISE is largely work in progress and there\r\nis a documentation (PDF, HTML, etc) but that too is work in progress.\r\n* RISE is very intuitive as you will quickly realize when you run the examples in RISE_toolbox\\examples\\\r\n* Should you want to report a bug, make a suggestion or need help, please send an email to [junior.maih AT gmail.com](junior.maih@gmail.com) ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
